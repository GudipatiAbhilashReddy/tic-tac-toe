# Noughts and Daggers

A simple implementation of the game "TIC TAC toe" using React, Styled Components, ImmutableJS, GraphQL and a little magic.

## Getting started

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Open your browser to 0.0.0.0:8090

## Plans for the near future
More and more hype-driven development.
Add Flow, Jest Snapshot testing, SSR, React Native implementation.

Would be cool, if you write to me about non compliance the best practices of programming in stack of React.
